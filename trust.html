    <h1>Understanding Trusts (Fideicomisos)</h1>
    

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What is a Fideicomiso?</h2>
      <p>A fideicomiso is a legal trust agreement used in Mexico to allow foreigners to purchase property within the restricted zonesâ€”defined as within 50 km of the coast or 100 km from a border.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>The trust is established through a Mexican bank, which holds the title to the property on behalf of the buyer (the beneficiary). As the beneficiary, you maintain full control: you can sell, rent, remodel, or bequeath the property.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Length and Renewal</h2>
      <p>Fideicomisos are valid for 50 years and can be renewed indefinitely. Renewal is a straightforward process that keeps ownership secure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Is It Safe?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Fideicomisos are recognized and regulated under Mexican law and offer the same rights and protections as direct ownership.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why Use a Trust?</h2>
      <p>This structure ensures that foreign investors comply with constitutional restrictions while enjoying the same benefits and protections as any property owner in Mexico.</p>
